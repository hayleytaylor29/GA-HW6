# Finish up those labs

## Complete [Tic-Tac-Toe Lab](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CXbc8eG--BZ-BZlvpG4cshBzBeX2aeDG/view)

Focus on getting all of the functionality.

If you got far during class time, be creative about addition features like:
- a button to reset the board to play again
- an array of arrays for the winning conditions to check for the winning conditions
- determine whether it is a tie before all of the squares are filled in
e.g. with O to make the next move, we know that O can only move to the top right space, and it would be a tie; can we mark this a tie before the move is made?
```
OX
OOX
XOX
